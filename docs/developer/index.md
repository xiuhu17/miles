## TL;DR for first-time contributors

1. Pick something small from `good first issue` on [GitHub](https://github.com/radixark/miles/issues).
2. Run the [Reproducibility recipe](/examples/reproducibility) so you can be sure
   "I changed X and it broke" actually means that.
3. Use `--debug-train-only` or `--debug-rollout-only` to scope your changes.
4. Open a PR. We'll review within ~48h.
