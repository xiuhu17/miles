"""Trajectory-lifecycle seam callable from core rollout code.

A neutral observation point at the same layer as ``Timer.event_sinks``: core
generation paths (``sglang_rollout``, ``generate_hub``) read
``TrajectoryLifecycle().sink`` unconditionally, so this module must never
import anything from the dashboard extra. The sink object itself is constructed and installed by
``miles.dashboard.hooks`` when the dashboard is enabled; while it is ``None``
every probe site is a guarded no-op.
